ResidualBasis:
  # [string] file name root for the residual basis.
  # Assumes decomposed files with the names <residual-basis-root-name>.XX.YY,
  # where XX is the total number of files and YY is the rank number for a given file.
  # Note that the total number of files must be = to MPI size
  file-root-name: "matrix.bin"

  # [string] binary or ascii: format of the residual basis file(s)
  format: "binary"

  # [int] number of columns in the residual basis
  num-columns: 4

  # [int] number of nodes in the mesh
  num-mesh-nodes: 9

  # [int] number of degrees of freedom at each mesh node
  dofs-per-mesh-node: 2


SampleMesh:
  # [int] number of desired nodes in the sample mesh
  num-sample-mesh-nodes: 4

  # [double] between 0.0 and 1.0: weight to blend leverage score
  # pmf with uniform pmf over mesh nodes.
  # Setting to 0.0 implies the pmf to be uniform,
  # while 1.0 recovers the leverage score pmf.
  # if you don't know, try 0.5
  leverage-score-beta: 0.5

  # [string], optional: path and filename for an ascii file which
  # contains a list of nodes (global ids) to include in the sample mesh
