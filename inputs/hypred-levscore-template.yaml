ResidualBasis: 
  file-dir: "." # [string], optional: full path to where residual basis file is. Default: working directory
  file-root-name: "matrix.bin" # [string] file name root for the residual basis. Assumes decomposed files with the names <residual-basis-root-name>.XX.YY, where XX is the total number of ranks and YY is the rank number for a given file. 
  format: "binary" # [string] binary or ascii: format of the residual basis file(s)
  num-columns: 4 # [int] number of columns in the residual basis
  num-mesh-nodes: 9 # [int] number of nodes in the mesh
  dofs-per-mesh-node: 2 # [int] number of degrees of freedom at each mesh node 
SampleMesh: 
  num-sample-mesh-nodes: 4 # [int] number of desired nodes in the sample mesh
  leverage-score-beta: 0.5 # [double] between 0.0 and 1.0: weight to blend leverage score pmf with uniform pmf over mesh nodes. Setting to 0.0 set the pmf to be uniform, while 1.0 recovers the leverage score pmf. 
  sample-mesh-seed-nodes: "seed.txt" # [string], optional: path and filename for an ascii file which contains a list of nodes (global ids) to include in the sample mesh
