SVD:
  # [string] file name root for the residual basis.
  # Assumes decomposed files with the names <residual-basis-root-name>.XX.YY,
  # where XX is the total number of files and YY is the rank number for a given file.
  # Note that the total number of files must be = to MPI size
  file-root-name: "matrix.bin"

  # [string] binary or ascii: format of the residual basis file(s)
  format: "binary"

  # [int] number of columns in the residual basis
  num-columns: 4

  # node with info on how to handle the left-singular vectors
  leftSingularVectors:
    # filerootname follows same formatting as file-root-name above
    file-root-name: "lsv.txt"

    # format: ascii or binary
    write-format: "ascii"

    # how many vectors to write
    how-many: 2
