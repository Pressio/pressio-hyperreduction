  # file name root for the matrix file(s).
  # If doing parallel run: 
  #     assume files decomposed as <file-root-name>.XX.YY,
  #     where XX is the total number of files and YY is the rank number for a given file.
  #     Note that the total number of files must be = to MPI size
  # If doing onnode: 
  #     assume single file named <file-root-name>.1.0

  format: "binary" or "ascii"
