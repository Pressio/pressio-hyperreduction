SVD:
  # root of file name for the matrix.
  # If doing parallel SVD: 
  #     we assume files decomposed as <file-root-name>.XX.YY,
  #     where XX is the total number of files and YY is the rank number/file ID.
  #     Note that the total number of files must be = to MPI size
  # If doing onnode SVD: 
  #     assume single file named <file-root-name>.1.0
  #
  file-root-name: "matrix.bin" #this is just an example

  # format of the file(s)
  format: "binary" or "ascii"

  # [int] number of columns of the matrix to read
  num-columns: 4

  # node with info on how to handle the left-singular vectors
  leftSingularVectors:
    # filerootname follows same formatting as file-root-name above
    file-root-name: "lsv.txt"

    # format: ascii or binary
    write-format: "ascii"

    # how many vectors to write
    how-many: 2
