# Overview

This repository provides capabilities for:

- computing the SVD of a distributed matrix

- computing sample mesh indices for hyperreduction via

	- Discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM)

	- other methods TBD

It is developed as an auxiliary tool to
the [pressio C++ library](https://pressio.github.io/pressio/html/index.html)
and its [Python bindings library](https://pressio.github.io/pressio4py/html/index.html).

Pressio is an open-source computational framework aimed at enabling
leading-edge projection-based reduced-order models (pROMs) capabilties
for dynamical systems in science and engineering.
