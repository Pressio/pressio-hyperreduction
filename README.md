# Overview

Pressio is an open-source computational framework aimed at enabling
leading-edge projection-based reduced-order models (pROMs) capabilties
for dynamical systems in science and engineering.

This repository contains tools supporting:

- TSQR-based SVD of a distributed matrix

- computation of sample mesh indices for hyperreduction via

	- Discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM)

	- other methods TBD


# Note, Userguide and documentation

This library is fully self-contained and can be used independently.

However, it is mainly developed as an auxiliary tool to
the [pressio C++ library](https://pressio.github.io/pressio/html/index.html)
and its [Python bindings library](https://pressio.github.io/pressio4py/html/index.html).
