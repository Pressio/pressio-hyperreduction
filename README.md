# Overview

Pressio is an open-source computational framework aimed at enabling
leading-edge projection-based reduced-order models (pROMs) capabilties
for dynamical systems in science and engineering.
This is the repository containing tools for computing hyperreduction.

# Note, Userguide and documentation

This Python library was developed as an auxiliary tool to
the [pressio C++ library](https://pressio.github.io/pressio/html/index.html)
and its [Python bindings library](https://pressio.github.io/pressio4py/html/index.html).
However, it is fully self-contained and can be used independently.
